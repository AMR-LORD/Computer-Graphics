## **Displays and Inputs**

### **CRT (Cathode-Ray Tube)**

One of the earliest technologies that converted electronic signals into visible images. CRTs laid the foundation for modern display systems — from old TVs to computer monitors throughout the 20th century.

### **Brief History**

- **1897:** Invented by German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun, first used in radar and scientific devices.
- **1920s–1930s:** Became a key component in early televisions.
- **1950s:** Introduction of **Shadow Mask** enabled color CRTs.
- **1980s–1990s:** Dominated computer and gaming displays due to rich colors and affordability.
- **2000s onward:** Declined with the rise of flat-panel displays (LCD, LED).

### **How CRT Works**

A CRT consists of:

1. **Electron Gun:** Emits high-speed electrons.
2. **Phosphor-Coated Screen:** Lights up when struck by electrons.
3. **Magnetic Deflection Coils:** Steer the electron beam line by line (Raster-Scan) or vector by vector (Random-Scan).

**Steps:**

1. Electron gun fires a beam.
2. Magnetic coils guide the beam across the screen.
3. Beam hits phosphor, producing visible light (pixels).
4. Process repeats rapidly (refresh rate) to prevent flicker.

### **Pros of CRT**

- Rich, accurate colors
- Wide viewing angles (up to 180°)
- Long-lasting and durable

### **Cons of CRT**

- Bulky and heavy
- High power consumption
- Emits electromagnetic radiation

## **Key Terms**

### **Refresh Rate**

- **Definition:** Number of times the image is redrawn per second.
- **Unit:** Hertz (Hz) — e.g., 60Hz = 60 frames/sec
- **Importance:** Higher rates = smoother motion and less flicker. Essential for gaming and animation.

### **Persistence**

- **Definition:** Time the phosphor remains lit after being hit by the electron beam.
- **Low Persistence:** Requires high refresh rates to prevent flicker.
- **High Persistence:** Reduces flicker but can cause motion blur or ghosting.

**Example:** Like chalk on a board — if it fades quickly, you must redraw often (low persistence); if it lingers, you redraw less (high persistence).

## **Types of CRT Displays**

### **Refresh CRTs**

(Not a separate type — describes how images are constantly redrawn to stay visible)

- Uses a phosphor screen excited by electron beams.
- Includes **Raster-Scan** and **Random-Scan** displays.
- Requires consistent refreshing to prevent image decay.

**Pros:**

- Stable, flicker-free image
- Ideal for dynamic content

**Cons:**

- Requires high refresh rates
- Increases power consumption

---

### **1. Raster-Scan Displays**

- Electron beam scans line-by-line from top to bottom.
- Common in TVs and computer monitors.
- Uses **Frame Buffer** to store pixel data.

**Pros:**

1. Realistic images
2. Millions of colors possible
3. Supports shading and shadows

**Cons:**

1. **Low Resolution:** Limited by pixel count; edges may appear jagged unless resolution is very high.
2. **Expensive:** Needs large memory (Frame Buffer), fast processors, and advanced display hardware.

**Additional Note:**

- Flickering can occur at low refresh rates.
- High demand on hardware due to pixel-by-pixel processing.

---

### **2. Random-Scan Displays (Vector Displays)**

- Draws images by tracing lines between defined points.
- Suitable for line art and technical drawings.

**Pros:**

- High accuracy for line drawings
- No need for high refresh rates

**Cons:**

- Poor support for complex or colored images
- More costly for general-purpose use

---

### **3. Color CRT Monitors**

- Use three electron guns (Red, Green, Blue).
- Combines signals to produce full-color images.

**Pros:**

- Accurate color rendering
- Dominated markets before flat panels

**Cons:**

- Color misalignment may occur
- High power usage

---

### **4. Flat-Panel Displays**

Modern displays replacing CRTs, including LCD, LED, Plasma, OLED.

**Pros:**

- Slim and lightweight
- Lower power usage
- Higher resolutions and better viewing angles

**Cons:**

- Initially expensive
- Older LCDs had narrow viewing angles

---

## **Summary**

- **Refresh CRTs:** Constantly redraw images to keep them visible.
- **Raster-Scan:** Line-by-line drawing, ideal for photos and videos.
- **Random-Scan:** Line-based drawing, ideal for CAD/engineering.
- **Color CRTs:** Use RGB electron guns for color images.
- **Flat Panels:** Modern replacements offering better efficiency and form factor.
